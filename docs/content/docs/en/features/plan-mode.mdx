## What is Plan Mode?

Plan Mode is a working mode that lets AI create a detailed plan before executing tasks.

In Plan Mode, AI will:

1. **Gather Information** - Use read-only tools to analyze code and requirements
2. **Create Plan** - Draft a detailed implementation approach
3. **Wait for Approval** - Present the plan for your review
4. **Execute Task** - Only start modifying files after you approve

## When to Use Plan Mode?

Plan Mode is suitable for the following scenarios:

- **Complex Tasks** - Changes involving multiple files or multiple steps
- **Important Changes** - Situations requiring plan review before execution
- **Learning Purpose** - Understanding how AI analyzes and solves problems

## How to Enable Plan Mode

In the toolbar below the chat input, find the **Plan Mode** toggle:

- **Enabled**: AI will create a plan and wait for your approval first
- **Disabled**: AI will execute tasks directly (Act Mode)

## Reviewing Plans

When AI completes a plan, you'll see a plan review card with three options:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Approve** | Approve the plan, AI starts execution |
| **Edit** | Edit the plan content before approving |
| **Reject** | Reject the plan, you can provide improvement suggestions |

After approving the plan, Plan Mode will automatically turn off and AI begins execution.
