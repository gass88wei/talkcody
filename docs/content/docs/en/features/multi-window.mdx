## Use Cases

The multi-window feature is particularly useful in these scenarios:

### Working on Multiple Projects

Open different projects in separate windows without frequent switching. Each window runs independently.

### Cross-Project Code Comparison

Place two windows side by side to easily compare code implementations across different projects.

### Multi-Monitor Workflow

Assign different project windows to different monitors to make full use of your screen space.
